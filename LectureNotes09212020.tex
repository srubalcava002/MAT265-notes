\section{Chain Rule}
All we went over was usage of the chain rule. I didn't take notes during class so here:\\
\\
The chain rule is: $\frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)$ where $f(x)$ is your outer function and $g(x)$ is your inner function.\\
\\
For example:\\
$\frac{d}{dx} sin(x^2) = cos(x^2) * 2x = 2xcos(x^2)$\\
